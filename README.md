# die-json
a json SAX parser based on finite automata. enable your favorite C++ compiler to C++14 in order to compile this lib

see also github.com/thinlizzy/die-xml - both projects use the same automata classes

# TEST
The directory die-json-test has the sources for unit tests for die-json. 
You will need to have tut.h in your include path to build the test application (which also will need to link with die-json).

TUT can be found here: http://mrzechonek.github.io/tut-framework/
